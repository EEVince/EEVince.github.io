		<p>Good start, isn't it? Ditch social media, keep the web free. We have heard so many times about the negative effects of social media on our mental health and privacy, yet most of us keep using it. Let's collectively STOP!</p>
		<p>Let me tell you why I am so aggressive about it.</p>
		<p>Let's start with a quick recap of the history of the web and how we got here.</p>
		<h3>Section I - History of the Web</h3>
		<p>The internet was originally designed to be a platform for experts in a field to share information with other experts in perhaps other fields. It was, therefore, inherently about information and knowledge from Day 1. Like a really convoluted library with as many corners as members, each contributing their own to the whole.</p>
		<p>Then, as the internet became public use, this notion expanded to not just be a reference library, with a bunch of "nerd stuff", but also for the internet to include journals, magazines, diaries, which did not convey scientific information, or perhaps information <em>per se</em>, but instead bits and pieces of people's personal lives, experiences, joys, sorrows, etc.</p>
		<p>Now, as you may know, technology was not quite the best at the time, so these sites were mostly static. The only people able to modify the contents of them were the creators of the sites themselves, the so-called <strong><em>webmasters</em></strong>.</p>
		<h4 style="text-align: center;">This is what we now call Web 1.</h4>
		<p>As the technology improved, there were more and more ways to interact with the websites themselves, or rather, their contents: comments started appearing under any blog post, guestbooks where people could write feedback about the website, or leave their goofy little note; chatrooms, where the visitors could interact with eachother.</p>
		<p>Then, social media sites like mySpace, twitter, Facebook, YouTube, reddit emerged, which took this interactivity to another new level, and created massive hubs where users could create media and share with each other. This was the dawn of "accounts". To use these sites, users had to create accounts, which were basically a table of information about each user. <sub>(not really safe, innit?) </sub></p>
		<h4 style="text-align: center;">This is, by definition, Web 2.</h4>
		<p>As time went on, these harmless new types of website grew out to be <strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">GIANT, MASSIVE</strong> corporations, with no longer the users in the focus, <strong>but profit</strong>. I could go into great detail how each and every social media platform is flawed and has rotten, but I'll keep you safe from my insanity. How do they get this money? Your. Data. Every time one signs up for a free account nowadays, he pays with his data. No wonder the EU made laws to make users clear what they were going into...who reads a TOS anyways? ..buncha nerds.</p>
		<p>And, dear user, you may have noticed, that the people of today really go on 4 or 5 websites per use of the internet. That is like if the infinite corners of the library were covered with black foil where only the "brave" ventured, because a "four-cornered library is more normal to the outsider, and thus, more profitable". Was that, dear user, the goal of the making public of the internet, so that in 20-odd years it would become a place with four goliaths guarding the gates of information and social interaction through the net? I thought not.</p>
		<p>Here, I would take the liberty to coin a new term: <em><strong>Web 1.5 </strong></em>- the goldilocks zone. Before profit-centered mega-corporations, before social media, or heck, maybe even before accounts were a thing, the internet was a place of creativity, of information-sharing, providing a more balanced life-web experience, because data required effort to be found in those infinite corners. One would come upon gems nobody has seen before.</p>
		<p>That age is what we should be striving for. The decentralised, common Internet, with many corners, and tresures to explore and unravel.</p>
		<h3>The New Web 1.5</h3>
