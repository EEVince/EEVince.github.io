		<p>Good start, isn't it? Ditch social media, keep the web free. We have heard so many times about the negative effects of social media on our mental health and privacy, yet most of us keep using it. Let's collectively STOP!</p>
		<p>Let me tell you why I am so aggressive about it.</p>
		<p>Let's start with a quick recap of the history of the web and how we got here.</p>
		<h3>Section I - History of the Web</h3>
		<p>The internet was originally designed to be a platform for experts in a field to share information with other experts in perhaps other fields. It was, therefore, inherently about information and knowledge from Day 1. Like a really convoluted library with as many corners as members, each contributing their own to the whole.</p>
		<p>Then, as the internet became public use, this notion expanded to not just be a reference library, with a bunch of "nerd stuff", but also for the internet to include journals, magazines, diaries, which did not convey scientific information, or perhaps information <em>per se</em>, but instead bits and pieces of people's personal lives, experiences, joys, sorrows, etc.</p>
		<p>Now, as you may know, technology was not quite the best at the time, so these sites were mostly static. The only people able to modify the contents of them were the creators of the sites themselves, the so-called <strong><em>webmasters</em></strong>.</p>
		<h4 style="text-align: center;">This is what we now call Web 1.</h4>
		<p>As the technology improved, there were more and more ways to interact with the websites themselves, or rather, their contents: comments started appearing under any blog post, guestbooks where people could write feedback about the website, or leave their goofy little note; chatrooms, where the visitors could interact with eachother.</p>
		<p>Then, social media sites like mySpace, twitter, Facebook, YouTube, reddit emerged, which took this interactivity to another new level, and created massive hubs where users could create media and share with each other. This was the dawn of "accounts". To use these sites, users had to create accounts, which were basically a table of information about each user. <sub>(not really safe, innit?) </sub></p>
		<h4 style="text-align: center;">This is, by definition, Web 2.</h4>
		<p>As time went on, these harmless new types of website grew out to be <strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">GIANT, MASSIVE</strong> corporations, with no longer the users in the focus, <strong>but profit</strong>. I could go into great detail how each and every social media platform is flawed and has rotten, but I'll keep you safe from my insanity. How do they get this money? Your. Data. Every time one signs up for a free account nowadays, he pays with his data. No wonder the EU made laws to make users clear what they were going into...who reads a TOS anyways? ..buncha nerds.</p>
		<p>And, dear user, you may have noticed, that the people of today really go on 4 or 5 websites per use of the internet. That is like if the infinite corners of the library were covered with black foil where only the "brave" ventured, because a "four-cornered library is more normal to the outsider, and thus, more profitable". Was that, dear user, the goal of the making public of the internet, so that in 20-odd years it would become a place with four goliaths guarding the gates of information and social interaction through the net? I thought not.</p>
		<p>Here, I would take the liberty to coin a new term: <em><strong>Web 1.5 </strong></em>- the goldilocks zone. Before profit-centered mega-corporations, before social media, or heck, maybe even before accounts were a thing, the internet was a place of creativity, of information-sharing, providing a more balanced life-web experience, because data required effort to be found in those infinite corners. One would come upon gems nobody has seen before.</p>
		<p>That age is what we should be striving for. The decentralised, common Internet, with many corners, and tresures to explore and unravel.</p>
		<h3>Section II - The New Web 1.5</h3>
		<p>Many people feel nostalgia, or even <a title="What's that?" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anemoia" target="_blank">anemoia</a> for this time of the more "human" internet. But movements fueled by nostalgia always tend to go backwards instead of clearly stating their goals and applying them to the present day. That is why we must be clear in defining what made Web 1.5 so unique and worthy of nostalgia.</p>
		<p>Here's a non-exhaustive list:</p>
		<ul class="main-list">
		<li>high degree of personalisation:
		<ul class="sub-list">
		<li>no websites were alike</li>
		<li>creative designs which were shamelessly shared among webmasters</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>remembering the human
		<ul class="sub-list">
		<li>the personalised spaces enabled the realisation that there are, in fact, actual humans behind the content (as opposed to today's algorithms: we all know our stream of content on big social media sites is non-human curated)</li>
		<li>the element of innocent social interaction: people used their anonymity to do the most ""cringe"" stuff imaginable (more about cringe culture in a later post)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>more natural lifetime of content/creations<br />
		<ul class="sub-list">
		<li>today's algorithms reward and make viral content that may not be of the highest quality</li>
		<li>viral content dies off, and rarely becomes part of "internet culture"</li>
		<li>meanwhile in the age of discovering creators yourself, it was not uncommon for a meme or a piece of art to echo for years on end on the different websites and blogs, thus creating a kind of "culture"</li>
		<li>smaller artists could also be easier recognised, as the internet provided all a fairly even playing field</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>decentralised
		<ul class="sub-list">
		<li>the web was more diverse, as I already expressed in my metaphor of the library with infinitely many corners</li>
		<li>content was in the hands of the creators (!)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Knowing this, it is easy to put together the goals of the new Web 1.5 (I'm not even gonna bother, yesterweb.org made <a title="yesterweb's manifesto" href="https://yesterweb.org/#manifesto" target="_blank">a much better post</a> about this)</p>
		<h3>Section III - Stop Web 3</h3>
		<center><img src="../../img/gifs/stickers/blinkies/noweb32.gif" style="height:80px"></center>
		<p>There have been a few alternatives proposed to the current, horrible state of the internet, and one of these is the so-called Web 3, which bases itself on the idea of decentralisation by <a title="What's that?" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank">blockchain</a>. You may have heard some crypto-heads go all crazy on hearing this one word, but in reality, this proposal is more exploitative than the web we have now.</p>
		<p>Sure, it may be all anonymous, but this idea would revolve around money, and we know, whenever money enters the equation, s**t hits the fan. When one reads into it, it shows itself to be nothing more than another ponzi/pyramid scheme. (here I would also recommend yesterweb.org's <a title="Stop Web 3!!!" href="https://yesterweb.org/no-to-web3/" target="_blank">post</a> on this) You have probably all heard of NFTs, cryptocurrency and their crazy instability. Do you want the web to look like that in the future? NO!!!</p>
