			<p><em><strong>Finally! </strong></em>After long waiting and toil with the programming, both the ram-blog itself and the preview on the homepage looks just how I wanted!</p>
			<h3>META, SOMEWHAT TECHNICAL CONTENT UPCOMING</h3>
			<p>This was actually my first time programming in JavaScript, and let me tell you, I got really familiar with DOM's and embeds and file loading and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.</p>
			<p>Lots of people say that JavaScript's syntax is hard, but in fact, it is not too far from the syntax of any other functional programming language, like F#, for example. What is hard is actually integrating the code in a website in a safe/anonymous manner.</p>
			<p>I'm looking forward to writing some more dumb stuff on this blog, so stay tuned!</p>
