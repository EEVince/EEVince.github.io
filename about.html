				<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>Hi! I am Vince, a Roman Catholic teenager from Hungary, with a passion for creative hobbies. I like playing music, designing electronic circuits, have an interest for synths (though I am no synth-nerd <sub>yet...</sub>), and learning languages!</p>
				<p>As you can see based on the style of my website, I long for the simpler times of the web, of the early-mid 2000s. I'm kinda a retro computer geek.</p>
				<h2>Languages I speak</h2>
				<p>My mother tongue is of course <strong title="Hit me up, if you want to learn!">Hungarian</strong>, but I speak these languages:<br>
				<sub style="margin-bottom:40px;">P.S.: If you hover your mouse over them, you'll see fun facts! Try them!</sub></p>
				<table id="languages">
					<tbody>
						<tr id="fieldname">
							<td>Language</td>
							<td>Level</td>
						</tr>
						<tr title="Fun fact: I speak in a mix of Australian and RP.">
							<td>English</td>
							<td>fluently</td>
						</tr>
						<tr title="Früher hatte ich keine Lust aufs Deutschlernen, aber wie auf einen Zauberschlag, habe ich mich in die Sprache verliebt.">
							<td>German</td>
							<td>fluently</td>
						</tr>
						<tr title="2023年和2025年中间我没学习汉语了，因为我必须通过德语C1级考试。我忘记了比期待更多！＞﹏＜">
							<td>Mandarin Chinese</td>
							<td>mediocre</td>

						</tr>

				<p>Soooo, if you speak any of these languages, hi! </p>
				<p><strong>My original goal</strong> for this website was to publish a progress blog on my DIY Synth project, but I expanded it to be my personal website as well, hence the name: EEVince, from <strong>E</strong>lectronics <strong>E</strong>ngineer Vince</p>
				<p>(I'm still an EE student though!)</p>
				<h2>The musician in me</h2>
				<p>I started playing the keyboard at the age of 6, went to basic music school for 8 years, finished it. My current keyboard is this beauty, the KORG Pa600, with which I play in a local band called StartBand. I started playing the saxophone in 2022, on alto, and later moved to tenor sax. I have a great passion for creating new pieces of music, and to be frank, I am one of those weird music theory geeks. I use mostly MuseScore and Renoise to make music, the first for quickly jotting down ideas, the other for chiptune producing.</p>
				<h2>The history of my nickname</h2>
				<p>You might be wondering what a bird is doing on the front page of my website: here's the story. In "ye olden days" on the internet I was known by the handle vince1995, which was a bit confusing to many at that time, because in fact, I am a 2000s kid. The story goes something like this: when I first registered to a social media platform, I could choose a username. Because at the time, I was a regular at the town library's computer section, I registered (on motivation from my friend) under the handle vince (my name) and 1995.</p>
				<h4>Why exactly 1995?</h4>
				<p>Because one of the computers' case was so old, it still had a "Designed for Windows 95" sticker on it. And, because vince95 was taken, I opted for vince1995.</p>
				<p>I was using that nickname throughout most of my childhood, but as I grew older, I realised: It isn't always the best idea to use my real name on the internet, so I decided to change it: <strong>to <em>what</em>&nbsp; though?</strong></p>
				<h3><strong>The story of my current handle: vrvogel4</strong></h3>
				<p>I wanted to find something that still captured the childlike origins of my old nickname, so I thought: what else did young me like? And then it hit me: <em><strong>DINOSAURS!</strong></em> <sub>i'm not autistic, i swear</sub></p>
				<p>One of my favourite dinosaurs was the so-called Archaeopteryx, which is the closest known relative to the dinosaur that gave way to today's birds (which I also love!). So I tried this handle, but on some websites, like reddit and YouTube (ew, i know, right?) it was already taken. So, because I speak German anyway, I tried the German name: <strong>Urvogel</strong>. Which was, unsurprisingly, also taken. In my despair, I compromised and was like: well, I like classical history, and they didn't have the letter U anyway, so I'm just going to replace it with the letter v!</p>
				<h3 style="text-align: center;">And so was the nickname born:</h3>
				<h3 style="text-align: center;">v r v o g e l.</h3>
				<p></p>
				<p><sub>And yes, that technically means it is pronounced like the German word Urvogel, with an oo, and not with a v.</sub></p>
